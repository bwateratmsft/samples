# VS Code Docker Samples

This repository contains some samples for playing with the [Docker extension for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-docker). You can open the `flaskapp` or `expressapp` folders in VS Code to try each. Note: this repository isn't meant to be opened in VS Code from the root.
